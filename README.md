# Shallow Neural Network Training Coursework

Evaluating a neural network using the MatLab `cancer_dataset`. Development contained in the [nncw.ipynb](nncw.ipynb) notebook.

1. Evaluate the network's tendency to overfit by varying the number of epochs and hidden layers being used
2. Multiple classifier performance using majority vote
3. Repeat 2 with two different optimisers (`trainlm`, `trainrp`)
4. ***Extension***: Distinguish between two equi-probable classes of overlapping 2D Gaussians
